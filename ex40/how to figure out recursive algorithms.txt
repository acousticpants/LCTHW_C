how to make a recursive algorithm

figure out initial variables, how they change and their stopping conditions in each step

write recurs fn calling itself w\ args for each condition and variable

write setup fn for intial conditions and handle edge case then call recursive fn

setup fn returns final result and handle any edge cases recursive fn can't
